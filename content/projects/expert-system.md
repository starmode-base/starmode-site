Expert System is an observable, ambient reasoning system that turns the world’s unstructured information into a coherent, queryable and compounding knowledge corpus.

Research agents operate continuously—reading, compressing, and cross-linking primary sources to discover new insights and patterns grounded in source provenance. These agents also have direct access to public financial, market, and macroeconomic data, enabling quantitative validation and synthesis between narrative signals and hard data. The result is a feed of research briefs  revealing connections, second-order effects, and hypotheses that emerge only at machine scale.
