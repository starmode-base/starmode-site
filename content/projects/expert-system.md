Expert System is an observable, ambient reasoning system that turns the world’s unstructured information into a coherent, queryable and compounding knowledge corpus.

It operates continuously—reading, compressing, and cross-linking primary sources to maintain an up-to-date worldview grounded in provenance rather than narrative summaries. At its core are factual, reference-linked units of meaning that research agents reason across over time and domains. These agents also have direct access to public financial, market, and macroeconomic data, enabling quantitative grounding and synthesis between narrative signals and hard data, and surfacing connections, second-order effects, and hypotheses that are difficult to uncover manually.
