A lightweight, persisted in-memory database built from the ground up for the browser. PimDB delivers fast and efficient text indexing with substring, n-gram, and sorted indexes, enabling quick lookups for both partial and exact matches. On a dataset of 100,000 documents, it's currently **4,000x+ faster** than `Array.filter` for sorted lookups and **700x+ faster** for substring searches.
