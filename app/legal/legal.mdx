Your data's security is our top priority. We use industry-standard measures, such as encryption in transit and at rest, to keep your information safe.

### Your rights regarding your data

You have specific rights regarding your personal information:

- **Right to know**: You can request to know what personal information we collect, use, and share about you.

- **Right to delete**: You can request that we delete any personal information we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.

### Use of third-party services

We use third-party services, including OpenAI's language models (LLMs), to provide certain features of STΛR MODΞ. This means that some data you provide may be processed by OpenAI. OpenAI may temporarily store this data to improve their models and services, but they do not use it to build their models unless you’ve given permission.

We share this data only when necessary to deliver the services and features of STΛR MODΞ. We take precautions to ensure that your data is handled securely in line with our privacy commitments.

If you have any concerns about how your data is used with OpenAI or wish to know more, please contact us.

## Terms of service

By using STΛR MODΞ, you agree to these terms. Our service is provided "as-is," and while we do our best to keep everything running smoothly, we cannot guarantee perfect uptime or uninterrupted service. Please use the app responsibly and respect others.

STΛR MODΞ is currently only available to businesses and individuals located in the United States. By using our service, you confirm that you and your company are based in the US.

### Pre-orders

We are currently offering pre-orders of STΛR MODΞ. Please note that the app is still in development, and not all features will be available on day one when we launch. As we continue to improve STΛR MODΞ, planned features may evolve, change, or be dropped. We are committed to delivering a high-quality experience, but we reserve the right to adjust, update, or remove features as necessary.

By purchasing a pre-order plan, you acknowledge that some features may be released in phases, be subject to modification, or be omitted entirely.

### Refunds

Please note that we do not issue refunds for pre-orders or any other plans.
